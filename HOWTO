This should run in Matlab from the same directory in which you find this file. 

Before you start, a few mex files will need to be compiled. I've tried to wrap this up into a script, "install_sage.m" 

When you have all this working, try:

runLDA(5,1,500,'debug',1)

from the command line in matlab. This will run standard LDA first, then SAGE LDA. If you just want to run SAGE LDA, try:

runLDA(5,1,500,'debug',1,'do-non-sparse',0)
