This should run in Matlab from the same directory in which you find this file. You will need to compile a few mex files:

tamEStepInnerMex.c (optional, but faster)
utils/termCountsToWordListMex.c (mandatory)

You may also need to compile stuff in fastfit, lightspeed, and tprod, which are all in 3rd-party. There should be instructions in the relevant folders.

When you have all this working, try "runLDA(5,1,500,'debug',1)" from the command line in matlab. This will run standard LDA first, then SAGE LDA.
